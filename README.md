# ehealth_routing

Flutter mobile app for eHealth Routing, built by students in Purdue University.

## What does this app do?

So far, this Flutter app accomplishes basic features of Google Maps while focusing on routing and directions. Some of these basic features include the ability for users to manipulate the Map with gestures, add multiple stops/markers, rearrange and remove markers, see the distance and time to complete the entire route, use their own location, and add markers by searching for a location or address.

Soon, this app will showcase the Neareast Neighbor Algorithm in the famous Traveling Salesman problem while using the Google Maps API.
